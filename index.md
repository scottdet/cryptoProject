## Introduction

I'm currently a fourth year student at UCLA studying computational mathematics. For this project I am pulling various cryptocurrencies pricing and volume data with the aim of making more informed trades based on a few features I will calculate using this data. I am also hoping to implement sentiment analysis in order to determine if bulk sentiment holds any merit in making future predictions. 

## Goals

- Write a script to pull pricing and volume data from a web browswer (do not want to pay for data or be rescrticed to large time scales)
- Store data locally 
- Pull Tweets containing key words like "Bitcoin" and "Ethereum"
- Calculate covariances between cryptocurrencies

## Future Directions

- Calculate more technical features. What is predictive of future price?
- Merge various scripts into a working pipeline
- Deploy a trading algorithm

## Code

- Scraper
- Tweets
- Technical

(links coming soon)

## Progress Reports 

- Week 5
  - Project approved
  - Starting to research where I will get my data from
-
- Week 6
  - Working with Selenium in Python to pull data
  - Significant difficulties getting dependencies and Selenium subprocceses working 
-
- Week 7
  - First real Progress, scraper is operational for BTC, ETH, Litecoin
  - Starting to pull volume data 
  - Need to parse data correctly and output cleaning to a file
-  
- Week 8
  - Previous weeks todo is done, going to dive into pulling Tweets based on keywords
  - Researching Twitter's policy on pull requests and bot regulations
-  
- Week 9
  - Getting tweets based on keywords
  - There are a few sentiment analysis libraries for Python, need to research pros and cons/implementation
  - Focusing on cleaning up the Twitter/Price scriipts
-  
- Week 10
  - Beginning to calculate other features that could be helpful in prediction
  - I will need to learn a lot more about economics before this trading bot is operational
  - Putting it together here for a better presentation
